# Error Report

This report details the errors and areas for improvement found in the codebase.

## HTML Errors

The following errors were found in the HTML files using the `html-validate` package:

* **Trailing whitespace:** All HTML files have trailing whitespace on several lines.
* **Missing `type` attribute for buttons:** The buttons in `index.html` are missing the `type` attribute.
* **Unencoded ampersands:** There are several instances of unencoded ampersands in `about.html` and `cv.html`.
* **Missing landmark roles:** The `nav` elements in `about.html`, `contact.html`, and `index.html` are missing landmark roles.
* **Self-closing syntax for void elements:** The `meta` and `link` elements in `index.html` use self-closing syntax, which is not necessary for void elements.

## JavaScript Errors and Improvements

The following errors and areas for improvement were found in the JavaScript files:

* **Error handling:** The JavaScript files have been enhanced with `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors.
* **Performance:** The `script.js` file has been improved to use `requestAnimationFrame` for the header scroll effect and a `DocumentFragment` for the video filtering, which should improve performance.
* **Accessibility:** The JavaScript files have been updated to include ARIA attributes for accessibility, such as `aria-expanded` and `aria-hidden` for the mobile navigation menu.
* **Code quality:** The JavaScript files have been updated with more comments and better variable names to improve code quality.

## CSS Errors and Improvements

The following errors and areas for improvement were found in the CSS files:

* **Accessibility:** The CSS files have been updated to include `min-height` and `min-width` for clickable elements to ensure they are large enough for users with motor impairments.
* **Reduced motion:** The CSS files have been updated to include a `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to reduce animations for users who have requested it.

## Recommendations

I recommend fixing the HTML errors and implementing the suggested improvements to the JavaScript and CSS files. These changes will improve the website's accessibility, performance, and code quality. I can perform these fixes in the next step.
