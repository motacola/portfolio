2. Right-click `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"
4. Auto-refreshes when you make changes!

```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Contact form doesn't send emails?**
- It's currently simulated (shows success message)
- To make it real, you need a backend (see FIXES_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md)

**Favicon not showing?**
- Make sure file is named exactly: `favicon.ico`
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

**CV download not working?**
- Make sure PDF is in `documents/` folder
- File name must be exactly: `Christopher_Belgrave_CV.pdf`

**Social links go to wrong place?**
- Update the URLs in both HTML files (see step 3 above)
