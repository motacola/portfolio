# Testimonials Section Removed

## Change Summary

Removed the "Client Testimonials" section from the About page as requested by the user.

## Reason

The testimonials were placeholder content and not based on real client feedback.

## Files Modified

### 1. **about.html**
- **Removed:** Entire testimonials section (lines 168-279)
- **Location:** Between Skills section and Experience section
- **Content Removed:**
  - Section heading and subtitle
  - 6 testimonial cards with ratings
  - Placeholder testimonials from fictional clients

### 2. **css/about.css**
- **Removed:** All testimonials styling (lines 530-644)
- **CSS Classes Removed:**
  - `.testimonials-section`
  - `.section-subtitle`
  - `.testimonials-grid`
  - `.testimonial-card`
  - `.testimonial-rating`
  - `.testimonial-text`
  - `.testimonial-author`
  - `.author-info`

## Current Page Structure

The About page now flows directly from:
1. Profile Section (with headshot)
2. Skills Section
3. **Experience Section** ← Immediately follows skills
4. Notable Clients Section
5. CTA Section

## Impact

- ✅ Cleaner, more authentic portfolio
- ✅ Faster page load (removed ~115 lines of HTML)
- ✅ Reduced CSS file size (removed ~115 lines of CSS)
- ✅ More professional presentation with only verified information

## Note for Future

If you want to add real testimonials later:
1. Collect actual quotes from clients (with permission)
2. Use LinkedIn recommendations
3. Request written testimonials from past collaborators
4. Include real names, titles, and companies (with consent)

The CSS and HTML structure can be easily restored if needed.
